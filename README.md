# Curried. Debounced.

Currying functions randomly popped into my head this morning. This was closely followed by a second thought: "Man, when's the last time I had to curry a function?" Same for debounce.

It's just so easy to rely on any of the great utility libraries out there ... and then I got spooked by skill atrophy. If you don't use it you lose it.

So a currying/debouncing we go!

Just staying sharp.
