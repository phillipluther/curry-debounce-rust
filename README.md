# Curried. Debounced.

Currying functions randomly popped into my head this morning. This was closely followed by a second thought: "Man, when's the last time I had to curry a function?" Same for debounce.

It's just so easy to rely on any of the great utility libraries out there ... and then I got spooked by skill atrophy. If you don't use it you lose it.

So a currying/debouncing we go!

Just staying sharp.

## Testing

Clone the repo, install deps (2 for testing only), run the tests.

```
> git clone git@github.com:phillipluther/curry-debounce-rust.git
> cd curry-debounce-rust
> npm i
> npm run test
```
